            Enables the heap tracing API defined in esp_heap_trace.h.

            This function causes a moderate increase in IRAM code side and a minor increase in heap function
            (malloc/free/realloc) CPU overhead, even when the tracing feature is not used.
            So it's best to keep it disabled unless tracing is being used.

            Number of stack frames to save when tracing heap operation callers.

            More stack frames uses more memory in the heap trace buffer (and slows down allocation), but
            can provide useful information.
